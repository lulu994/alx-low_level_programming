# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## C - Preprocessor

###### The preprocessor is a part of the C programming language that is used to process the source code before it is compiled. It performs various useful tasks such as conditional compilation, file inclusion and macro expansion.

###### The preprocessor directives begin with a hash sign (#) and are processed by the preprocessor before the code is passed on to the compiler. Some of the commonly used preprocessor directives in C include #include, #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, #endif, #pragma etc.
