# PROJECT : 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

### A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable or object in the system. It can be used to access and manipulate the data stored in the memory location pointed to by the pointer.

### An array is a container that holds a fixed-size collection of elements that are of the same data type. The elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which can be accessed using an index.

### Strings are a sequence of characters that are terminated by a null character '\0'. In C programming, strings are represented as an array of characters, where the last element is always the null character.

#### In summary, pointers, arrays, and strings are all important concepts in C programming and understanding their relationships can help in writing efficient and logical code.

- File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

- File: `0-reset_to_98.c` is a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

- File: `1-swap.c` is a function that swaps the values of two integers.

- File: `2-strlen.c` is a function that returns the length of a string.

- File: `3-puts.c` is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

- File: `4-print_rev.c` is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- File: `5-rev_string.c` is a function that reverses a string.

- File: `6-puts2.c` is a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.

- File: `7-puts_half.c` is a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

- File: `8-print_array.c` is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- File: `9-strcpy.c` is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
