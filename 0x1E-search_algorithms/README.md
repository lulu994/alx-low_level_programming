# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

### Resources:

[Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
[Space complexity (1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

### General:

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

### More Info:
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- n*m -> O(nm)
- n square -> O(n^2)
- sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
- log(n) -> O(log(n))
- n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
- â€¦
