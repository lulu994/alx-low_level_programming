# PROJECT : 0x08. C - Recursion

#### Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In other words, it involves repeatedly breaking down a problem into sub-problems until it can be solved easily. Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller but similar problems, such as searching through a data structure, or navigating a complex tree structure. It is a powerful tool for solving complex problems in an elegant and efficient way, but it can also be tricky to get right and requires a good understanding of how it works.

File 0-puts_recursion.c is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

File 1-print_rev_recursion.c is a function that prints a string in reverse.

File 2-strlen_recursion.c is a function that returns the length of a string.

File 3-factorial.c is a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

File 4-pow_recursion.c is a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

File 5-sqrt_recursion.c is a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

File 6-is_prime_number.c is a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

File 100-is_palindrome.c is a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

File 101-wildcmp.c is a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. It uses the concept of wildcards.

File _putchar.c is a file containing the _putchar function.

File main.h is the header file containing the function prototypes.
